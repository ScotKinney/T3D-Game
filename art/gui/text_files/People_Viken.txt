The fur draped Vikens are fierce hunters
of anything and anyone, including the
wild Yeti who roam the land. The first
inhabitants were of a rugged breed with
ice in their veins and strength in their
hearts, undaunted by the piercing winds
of wintry weather. They'd prefer a chilly
dip in glacial waters over a hot after-
noon on the beach anyday!
