Kardia, the heart of Sparta,
beats with the sound of the
waves crashing on its luxurious
shores. The kingdom of Kardia, 
the first to be discovered, 
appeared to be perserved and 
required little restoration. 
Its palatial castle is enthroned 
at the foot of the mountains 
keeping guard over the grand 
arena and regal village below.
