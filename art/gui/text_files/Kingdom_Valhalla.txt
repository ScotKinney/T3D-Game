Nestled between the north mountains
and the Scandia Sea lies Valhalla, the
first rebuilt kingdom on Viken. Forts
and villages flank both sides of the 
land where the restored, majestic castle
rises up from the rocky banks of the
icy sea. The Gold Mine to the north
lures in the brave who dare search
the depths of its caverns.
